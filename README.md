Purpose:

- Scrape and save historical stock market data from Yahoo finance website.
- Use collected stock market data to train and validate an LSTM Machine Learning model for multi-day stock return predictions.

Technologies / Tools Used:

- Python
- Selenium
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Keras

Future Update Plans:

- Increase the number of stocks evaluated
    - Create new model versions for each stock that is evaluated
- Increase training dataset for each future model version to improve model accuracy
- Test how different an increase in LSTM nodes or training epochs affects model accuracy
- Increase the number of features
